# TripBook
This application allows users to plan trips with friends and families while also allowing users to post their photo albums and share their memories.

## User story 
```
AS A person wanting to plan a trip with a group,
I WANT to be able to view my trip ideas,
SO THAT I can plan accordingly for future holidays

```

## About The Project
Users can use kanban board found within the application to plan their trip ideas. UI allows users to add people into their circle and plan a trip together. From there, photos can be shared within the group and to-do lists can be created. Outside users can only view the photos uploaded but not contribute to the kanban board within the user's circle.
